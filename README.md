## Future development 

These are just some basic features for MindStone v1, many more are coming (if I find enough of interest and this will probably a premium/paid option):
- 🎯 Obsidian, Notion, VSCode Plugin 
- 🎯 Page Preview (like Obsidian Core plugin)
- 🎯 Andy Sliding pane
- 🎯 Full text search with `Cmd + K`
- 🎯 Infinite canvas for browsing through notes and connections

### Some know issues
This an early version of MindStone, which mean there are bugs and issues. Below are some known issues, that I plan to work on:
- Graphview does not load when clicking on side-bar or click node on graphview, browser reload will refresh it state
- Graph view layout and interaction is still very rough. More UI/UX improvements are needed.
- Transclusion is not working yet.
